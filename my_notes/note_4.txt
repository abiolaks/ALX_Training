Project "Make your own website"
You've set yourself up for success, now it's time to expand your mind and your belief in what you're capable of.
This experience is designed for everyone. From first time coders to experienced professionals.
We provide some tips and tricks, but remember, you are expected to go find answers to what you don't know or understand.

What can I make my website about?
Remember, you are applying to join the ALX Software Engineering Programme.
And at ALX, you will journey toward your life of impact by doing hard things.

Though you can pick a website theme of your choosing, here are a few suggestions:

Tell us about your personal mission
Tell us about an opportunity for impact in your community
Tell us about a venture you created
Tell us about your big hairy audacious goals
Think about how you will leverage your ALX Software Engineering training toward a meaningful career of growth and impact.

How far should I go?
As with all things at ALX, push yourself to go beyond what is asked for. Think about what aspects of the project you enjoy most and get creative!
During review, what you build extra will be taken into account just as much as what you're required to do.
At the very least, you must successfully complete all tutorials and designed tasks. And this project must showcase your original work.

Do not utilize frameworks like Bootstrap to do the work for you.
Important: You are not allowed to install, import or use external libraries. This website must be built with only HTML/CSS/JavaScript. No NodeJS, React, VueJS, Bootstrap, etc.

Once you decide your project is finished, click "I'm done with my Level 2 project!"

When youâ€™re ready to get started, connect to your server using SSH if you weren't already there, and go for it!

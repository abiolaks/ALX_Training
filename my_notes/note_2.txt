Your server is a distant machine. Everything i will run once logged in will not run on my computer, but on this distant computer
which is hosted in a datacenter, somewhere in the United States

IP address identifies each computer using the internet Protocol to comunicate over a network. it is just like a postal address
Type exit to exit your server and press enter(not shutdown or poweroff)
Type this command on linux to login to your server:ssh root@3.238.182.150, then enter pasword
and hit enter again now you are login
you see a warning message but you can always trust the host server that you were given

Getting the check what operating system my server is running

use the command uname(unix name) it prints the name version and other details about the current machine and the operating system running on it
